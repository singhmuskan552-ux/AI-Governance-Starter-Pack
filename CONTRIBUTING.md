# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest in the **AI Risk Toolkit**. Contributions that improve clarity, correctness, and usability are welcome — especially small, focused changes (typo fixes, README improvements, sample templates, or UX/formatting enhancements).

Please follow these quick guidelines so contributions are smooth and reviewable.

## How to contribute

### 1. Issues
- Open an issue when you find a bug, typo, or have a feature suggestion.
- Use a clear title and describe the problem or suggestion in 2–4 short paragraphs.
- Add labels (bug, enhancement, docs) if available.

### 2. Pull requests
- Fork the repo, create a branch named `contrib/<short-description>` (e.g., `contrib/fix-typo-readme`), make changes, and open a PR against `main`.
- Keep PRs small and focused — one change per PR is easiest to review.
- Include a short description and link to any related issue (if applicable).
- Use plain, readable commit messages (e.g., `docs(readme): fix typo in Overview`).

### 3. Style & format
- Keep language simple and professional.
- Use existing Markdown styles and section ordering from the README.
- For images/screenshots, add files under `/assets` and reference them relatively.
- No large binary files; add datasets or big files to a release or an external host.

### 4. Tests & checks
- This repo does not have an automated test suite; ensure any added sample files (spreadsheets, templates) open without errors.
- If you add scripts, include a short README snippet explaining usage.
