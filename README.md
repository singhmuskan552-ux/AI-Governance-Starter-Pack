## 🎯 Purpose Behind This Toolkit

As someone early in the Responsible AI space, I often found myself thinking:

> “I wish there was a simple, structured toolkit I could plug in while learning.”

I built this resource because I wanted governance tools that were **practical**, **accessible**, and **actionable** — especially for individuals, students, and small teams who don’t have enterprise-level frameworks.

This starter pack helps teams:

- Map and evaluate AI risks  
- Build lightweight governance foundations  
- Improve transparency and assurance  
- Prepare for upcoming AI regulations  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap (Planned Updates)

- ✔ Heatmap automation upgrade  
- ✔ Cleaner dropdown categories  
- ⬜ Add Responsible AI checklist  
- ⬜ Add model card template  
- ⬜ Add “AI use-case intake” workflow  
- ⬜ Add sample datasets and examples
